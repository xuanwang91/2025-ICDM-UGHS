## Eligibility
- Undergraduate students and high school students pursuing an academic degree at the time of submission are eligible to submit papers as first authors.
- Each submission must have at least one student author, who should be the presenter if the paper is accepted.
- Co-authorship with faculty members or researchers is allowed, but the student must be the primary contributor to the work.

## Submission Format Requirements
- Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscript Formatting Guidelines (see link to "formatting instructions" below: [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)).
- Undergraduate student research papers should not exceed 6 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.
- High school student research papers should not exceed 5 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.
