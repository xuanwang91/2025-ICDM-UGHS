- Each submission must have at least one student author, who should be the presenter if the paper is accepted.
- Co-authorship with faculty members or researchers is allowed, but the student must be the primary contributor to the work.

## Submission Format Requirements
- Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscript Formatting Guidelines (see link to "formatting instructions" below: [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)).
